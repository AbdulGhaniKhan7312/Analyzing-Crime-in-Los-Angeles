# Project Description
Los Angeles, California, attracts people from all over the world, offering lots of opportunities, not always of the good kind!

In this project, you'll serve as a data detective, supporting the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) in analyzing crime data to guide how they should allocate resources to protect the people of their city! Could you find out when and where crime is most likely to occur and what types of crimes are commonly committed in LA?
